This is no longer under active development. While I'm glad so many have found this script useful, I no longer have a use for it. I'm blindly accepting sane-looking pull requests. If you're interested in taking this over, fork it and I'll happily point people your way.

shared-photo-stream-backupper
=============================

A tool to identify and back up photos in an iCloud Shared Photo Stream to a given directory.

Gems Required:
--------------
* Rsync
* Sqlite3

Examples:
---------
As a quick reference, here's the help text:
```bash
$ ./photo_stream_backup.rb -h
Usage: photo_stream_backup.rb [options]
  -s, --streams X,Y,Z              The name of one or more streams that will be backed up, use "all" to back all of them up
  -d, --destination DEST           The destination folder for the images found, ie ~/Dropbox, etc
  -v, --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely
  -h, --help                       Display this screen
```

and here's what an example run looks like:
```bash
$ ./photo_stream_backup.rb -s all -d '~/Dropbox/Photos'
  Backing up stream 'My Most Awesome Photo Stream'
  Backing up 169 images...
  Backing up stream 'This Other Pretty Cool Photo Stream'
  Backing up 239 images...
```

Setup:
------
0) Install Dropbox

Instructions at https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=mac
Make sure you've got a folder in your Dropbox called `Photos`

1) Open a Terminal window

Open Finder and go to Utilities > Terminal

2) Install the required Ruby libraries:
```bash
# You should use Bundler for this, this was written either before Bundler or before I learned about it.
gem install rsync sqlite3
```

3) Download the code on this page using one of the following methods:

a) Via command line (in the same Terminal window):
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/braxtone/shared-photo-stream-backupper.git
```

b) Via the Github Mac application:

See https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories/#cloning for a great guide.

4) Install the workflow:

Open the shiny new folder full of coding awesomemess that you just downloaded via Finder. The easiest way to do this is go open a new Finder window, hit ⌘+⇧+G to open a specific folder, type `~/photo_stream_backupper`, and press Enter.

Once you have the folder open, double-click the `shared_photo_stream_backupper.workflow` file to install the workflow. You'll be asked if you want to install the folder action which you do, so click Install. If you're installing a newer version of the workflow, it might want to know if you're OK replacing whatever was there, so click Replace to confirm.

When you get the _Installation complete_ message, you're good to go. You can also take a look at the workflow and tweak the script by selecting _Open with Automator_.

5) Test

Now that the workflow is installed, you should test it out! Create a shared Photo Steam (http://help.apple.com/icloud/#mmc0cd7e99) if you haven't already, then add an image to it from the Photos app on your iThing. 

Within a minute or less, you should see a notification pop up on your Mac notifying you that new images have been copied over. Congrats!


To Do:
------

* Learn more about Automator workflows and allow a user to specify the directory that they want to back images up to
* More specific notifications about the number of images uploaded
* Come up with a snazzier name for this project, something clever to do with saving streams, windmills or something.
